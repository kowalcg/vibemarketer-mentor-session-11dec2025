# 🚀 QUICK START: Add Your Images in 3 Steps

## You have the images! Now save them with the right names:

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Save Your Professional Photo

**Right-click the headshot image** (the photo of you in the blue checkered shirt)
- Click **"Save Image As..."**
- Name it **exactly**: `greg-photo.jpg`
- Save location: **Same folder as presentation-dashboard-v1.html**

---

## ✅ STEP 2: Save RunMate Pro Screenshot

**Right-click the dark phone screenshot** (showing "241... TOTAL DISTANCE")
- Click **"Save Image As..."**
- Name it **exactly**: `runmate-pro-screenshot.png`
- Save location: **Same folder as presentation-dashboard-v1.html**

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Save SunUp Screenshot

**Right-click the light phone screenshot** (showing "Good to Go! 1.3 UV Index")
- Click **"Save Image As..."**
- Name it **exactly**: `sunup-screenshot.png`
- Save location: **Same folder as presentation-dashboard-v1.html**

---

## 📂 Your Folder Should Look Like This:

```
📁 3. Mentor Session/
  ├── presentation-dashboard-v1.html      ← Your presentation
  ├── greg-photo.jpg                      ← NEW: Your headshot
  ├── runmate-pro-screenshot.png          ← NEW: RunMate app
  └── sunup-screenshot.png                ← NEW: SunUp app
```

---

## 🎉 Done! Now Open the Presentation

Double-click **presentation-dashboard-v1.html** and all images will display perfectly!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

1. **File names must be EXACT** (lowercase, with dashes/hyphens)
2. **All files in the SAME folder** as the HTML file
3. **If images still don't show:**
   - Check file names match exactly
   - Make sure you saved in the correct folder
   - Try refreshing your browser (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)

---

## 💡 Alternative: Use the images folder

If you prefer to keep images organized:

1. Save all three images in the **images/** folder (that already exists)
2. Open `presentation-dashboard-v1.html` in a text editor
3. Find and replace:
   - `src="greg-photo.jpg"` → `src="images/greg-photo.jpg"`
   - `src="runmate-pro-screenshot.png"` → `src="images/runmate-pro-screenshot.png"`
   - `src="sunup-screenshot.png"` → `src="images/sunup-screenshot.png"`
