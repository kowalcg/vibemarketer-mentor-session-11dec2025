## Bios & Marketing Materials

### Final Approved Bio

Greg Kowalczyk is a Mechanical Engineer turned ecommerce founder, and the co-owner of two outdoor and health-focused brands. With no coding experience beyond a single Visual Basic class he took in university in the 1990s, Greg stepped into the 2025 AI toolchain — VibeCodeapp, Cursor, Claude Code, MCPs, and more — and used it to design and ship two fully functioning mobile apps: RunMate Pro and SunUp by GearTOP. He now has three additional apps in active development, ranging from outdoor safety tools to performance analytics.

Greg uses AI to accelerate product development and marketing, build educational ecosystems around physical products, and strengthen community connections through running groups, live events, and a race he's directing in 2026. His journey shows how non-technical founders can build real software and meaningful tools by combining persistence, curiosity, and the new wave of AI capabilities.

### Session Description (For Form Submission)

**Short Description**:
Greg Kowalczyk, co-founder of GearTOP and TapeGeeks, shares how he built two production-ready mobile apps — as a non-coder — using modern AI tools like VibeCode, Cursor 2.0, Claude Code, and MCPs. This session blends personal story, practical lessons, live dashboard-style visuals, and a clear framework for founders who want to build their own tools or workflows with AI. Perfect for entrepreneurs, marketers, and creators who want to understand how AI changes what's possible for small teams.

**Learning Outcomes**:
Participants will learn how a non-coder can design, build, and ship production-ready apps using modern AI tools. They'll understand how to combine AI assistants, VibeCoding, and debugging tools like Cursor and Claude Code to turn real problems into working software. They'll also learn how AI can accelerate product development, marketing, content creation, and customer connection for small teams.

**Actionable Outcomes**:
1. A simple 5-step framework to build their first AI-assisted app (from idea → PRD → prototype → testing → iteration)
2. A clear understanding of the 2025 AI toolchain (VibeCode, Cursor, Claude Skills, MCPs) and how to use each piece effectively
3. Practical examples they can copy for building internal tools, MVPs, or customer-facing products without writing traditional code

## 5-Step Framework

### How to Build Your First AI App

#### Step 1: Start with a Real Pain Point
- Must be something you personally feel
- Don't choose an idea you don't care about
- Use your own frustration as fuel
- Example: Greg's spreadsheet frustration with shoe tracking

#### Step 2: Use AI to Generate PRD + Prompts
**Process**:
- Talk through idea with ChatGPT/Claude
- Request Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- Ask for feature lists
- Request user flows
- Get wireframe suggestions
- Generate prompts for VibeCode

**Tools**: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini

#### Step 3: Build Small Pieces → Test Immediately
- Don't build everything at once
- Build one tiny feature
- Test in real world
- Get feedback
- Iterate
- Example: Greg testing GPS by running outside 100+ times

**Critical**: Test outside the development environment

#### Step 4: Use Cursor + Claude Code for Debugging
**When Things Break**:
- Take screenshot
- Send to Claude/ChatGPT
- Get explanation
- Use Cursor to implement fix
- Test again

**Reality**: Expect to go back and forth hundreds of times

#### Step 5: Track Versions - AI Drift is Real
**Best Practices**:
- Save versions frequently
- Be ready to undo changes
- AI will hallucinate
- AI will break working code
- Have rollback strategy
- Keep clean version history

**Example**: Greg rolled back 5 full days of work when AI broke too much
